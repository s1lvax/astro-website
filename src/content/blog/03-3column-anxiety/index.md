### Intro

I began my journey as a Tech Helpdesk Agent two years ago. Recently, I transitioned into developer work—a step up in responsibility and challenge. Naturally, with great power comes great responsibility (as an old man in _Spider-Man_ once said).

With new responsibilities, I also began facing increased anxiety. It’s entirely normal. After all, I’m human, and new experiences evoke such feelings. Determined to be an effective leader and keep growing, I turned to the audiobook _Feeling Good_ by Dr. David D. Burns, MD. You can find it [here](https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Good-David-D-Burns-audiobook/dp/B01N9TCVLD/?_encoding=UTF8&content-id=amzn1.sym.579192ca-1482-4409-abe7-9e14f17ac827&ref_=aufs_ap_sc_dsk).

The insights from the book are enlightening, and one technique, in particular, has transformed my approach to anxiety. If you’re on a journey of growth and responsibility, I believe this method will be beneficial for you too.

### Introducing the **3-Column Method**

Though it may seem simplistic at first, I encourage you to approach this with an open mind and give it a try.

### Obsidian Version

For those using Obsidian, setting up the 3-Column Method is straightforward. [Here’s a reference](https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-create-tables-obsidian/) for creating tables in Obsidian.

The columns are labeled as follows:

- **Automatic Thought**
- **Cognitive Distortion**
- **Rational Response**

Here’s how it works:

#### Step 1: Document Your Thoughts

Throughout the day, write down any anxiety-inducing thoughts in the first column. For example:

- _“I’m not a good leader.”_
- _“I’m not skilled enough to complete this project.”_

#### Step 2: Recognize the Cognitive Distortion

In the second column, identify the cognitive distortion at play. Examples include:

1. **All-or-Nothing Thinking**: Viewing situations in black-and-white categories.
2. **Overgeneralization**: Seeing a single negative event as a never-ending pattern.
3. **Mental Filter**: Focusing solely on the negative.
4. **Disqualifying the Positive**: Ignoring positive experiences.
5. **Jumping to Conclusions**: Making negative assumptions without evidence.
   - _Mind Reading_: Assuming others view you negatively.
   - _Fortune Telling_: Predicting a negative outcome.
6. **Magnification/Minimization**: Exaggerating negatives or minimizing positives.
7. **Emotional Reasoning**: Believing that feelings reflect reality.
8. **Should Statements**: Motivating oneself with “shoulds” or “oughts.”
9. **Labeling**: Attaching negative labels to oneself or others.
10. **Personalization**: Taking responsibility for events beyond one’s control.

#### Step 3: Draft a Rational Counter-Response

After identifying the distortion, write a more balanced, rational response. For example:

| Automatic Thought     | Cognitive Distortion                                 | Rational Response                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| I’m not a good leader | Labeling, Jumping to Conclusions, Overgeneralization | One mistake doesn’t define my abilities. Mistakes are part of growth, and my willingness to learn demonstrates potential for leadership improvement. |

### Paper Version

If you prefer a more tactile approach, replicate this method on paper. A notebook or journal can serve just as well for capturing thoughts, identifying distortions, and formulating rational responses.

This technique, despite its simplicity, is highly effective. Not only does it cultivate a calm and rational mindset, but over time, it helps you intuitively spot and manage cognitive distortions in your daily life.

Try it out, and you might find that dealing with anxiety becomes a more manageable part of your journey.
