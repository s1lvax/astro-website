### Intro

Who would have thought that a horror movie could provide life-changing insights?..

For as long as I can remember, I’ve had an active imagination, often filled with scenarios of what could go wrong. As a child, this meant fearing the woods because of stories like [Slender Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slender_Man) and avoiding the dark after hearing unsettling tales from friends.

As I matured, these fears transformed into more internalized worries. My mind often skipped over rational thoughts, jumping straight to worst-case scenarios. Over time, I realized this pattern was part of something deeper: anxiety. Anxiety works to cloud our judgment, creating a mental fog that can feel overwhelming and beyond our control.

### Recognizing the Pennywise Parallel

One day, I recognized a parallel that helped me better understand my anxiety: it functions similarly to [Pennywise](<https://stephenking.fandom.com/wiki/It_(Creature)>) from Stephen King’s _IT_. Just as Pennywise thrives on people’s fear, anxiety grows stronger when we respond to it with dread and avoidance. Pennywise appears all-powerful and terrifying, yet he’s ultimately defeated by children who choose to confront him. They refuse to let fear control them, instead mocking him and standing their ground. Their courage weakens the monster, allowing them to reclaim control.

### How I Took on My Anxiety

Following this realization, I adopted a similar approach to managing my anxiety. Here’s what worked for me:

1. **Assume Control**: Take a position of power over your mind. Assume control, even if that means verbalizing it to interrupt spiraling thoughts.
2. **Face the Fear**: Rather than avoiding unsettling thoughts, dive into them. Verbalize your intention to face the fears head-on instead of running.
3. **Rationalize Your Thoughts**: Once you’re confronting the anxiety directly, begin to rationalize each thought. Identify why certain fears don’t make sense and counter irrational beliefs.

For me, this approach worked wonders. The monster that had haunted me for years lost its power in a matter of seconds, and I could finally breathe and think clearly again.

Whenever I feel the anxiety creeping back, I remind myself: `I’ll still do what I want to do regardless, so bring it on—I’m not afraid anymore.` In a few seconds, the fear is diminished, and I regain control.

By reframing anxiety as a challenge to confront rather than a monster to fear, I’ve found new resilience and clarity. And, just like in the story of _IT_, facing what we fear can make even the scariest monster small and manageable.
