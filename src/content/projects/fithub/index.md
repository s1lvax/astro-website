**FitHub** is a self-hostable fitness tracker I built to give users full control over their progress data. It allows logging of weight, body fat percentage, and progress pictures while visualizing trends over time with interactive charts and timelines.

## üöÄ The Problem

Most fitness tracking apps come with limitations:

- **Data Privacy Concerns**: Many services store user data on third-party servers, raising privacy issues.
- **Cluttered & Complex Interfaces**: Many apps are bloated with unnecessary features that slow down usability.
- **Lack of Visual Tracking**: Few apps integrate both numerical progress and visual timelines effectively.

## üéØ Why I Built This

I wanted a simple yet powerful progress tracker that I could self-host and fully control. Existing solutions were either too restrictive, overloaded with unnecessary features, or lacked a good way to visually track progress over time.

## üí° My Solution

I developed **FitHub**, a lightweight, modern fitness tracker with:

- **A clean and responsive UI** for easy tracking and navigation.
- **Progress visualization** through charts and historical timelines.
- **Self-hosting capability** for complete data control.
- **Photo tracking** to see visual progress over time.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **SvelteKit**: A fast and lightweight frontend framework for smooth user interactions.
- **TailwindCSS**: For a sleek and modern UI.
- **Docker**: Ensures easy deployment and scalability.
- **PostgreSQL**: Flexible database options to store progress data securely.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Weight & Body Fat Tracking**: Log and visualize progress effortlessly.
- **Progress Picture Timeline**: See how your body has changed over time.
- **Interactive Charts**: Gain insights into trends in weight and body composition.
- **Self-Hosting**: Own your data with an easy-to-deploy setup.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.

## üìà The Result

FitHub provides a no-compromise fitness tracking experience tailored for privacy-conscious users like me. By focusing on a minimal yet effective feature set, it makes progress tracking simple, visual, and intuitive.
