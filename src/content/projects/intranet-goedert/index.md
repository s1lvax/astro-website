The Goedert Intranet, used for internal communications, photo-sharing, and document-sharing, was outdated and underutilized. The issues included:

- **Outdated Design**: The websiteâ€™s look did not engage employees, leading to missed communications.
- **Frontend Bugs**: Persistent bugs created a frustrating experience for users.
- **Inefficient Admin Panel**: HR and Marketing teams found the backend cluttered and challenging to use.

**Objective**: Our goal was a full overhaul with a modern design, bug fixes, and a user-friendly admin panel. Focus areas were improved user experience and streamlined backend content management.

**Solution**: We developed a new intranet with an intuitive design and robust functionality.

**Technologies Used**: Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Docker, and GitHub Actions for automated deployment.

**Key Features**: Professional animations, a clean admin panel, automated deployment, and email notifications for new posts.

**Result**: The revamped intranet boosted user engagement, and the improved admin panel empowered HR and Marketing to manage content effectively.
