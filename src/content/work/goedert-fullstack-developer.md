Beginning as a self-taught developer, I advanced to managing all development projects at Goedert Gestion. My responsibilities include creating websites and web applications that streamline workflows, allowing for more efficient operations and improved user experiences. I work with OLAP cubes to deliver detailed data insights and implement automations through API integrations, supporting dynamic, data-driven decision-making across the company.
