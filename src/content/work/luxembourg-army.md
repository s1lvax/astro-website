During my time as a recruit in the Luxembourg Army, I gained valuable experience in discipline, teamwork, and the importance of adhering to a structured chain of command. This role reinforced my understanding of respect, both towards authority and peers, and highlighted the critical role that courtesy plays in a high-stakes environment. These experiences instilled a strong foundation of reliability, collaboration, and procedural diligenceâ€”qualities I bring into every professional setting.
